My name is Meiers, and I am a neuroscience student at Bucknell University. I am minoring in chemistry and computer science. I am currently working on the chrome web extension [Eigofy](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eigofy/foefaklgdkdbnpfcfoiplcejnefgemnf) with two of my friends [Peter](https://github.com/Peter-Johnstone) and [Yuki](https://github.com/yuki18yao). I enjoy protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and data science. I have written scripts which convert pdb files to three.js objects and modeled these in WebXR. Recently, I have started learning Unity and C# where I am working to implement protein modeling in VR via the Unity Editor. I am always looking for cool new ideas to work on, so if you have any suggestions, please reach out!
